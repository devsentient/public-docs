# Notion Page to Markdown
Notion supports exporting to the markdown format. 

The notion-to-md.js script offers an alternative way to convert a notion page to the markdown format locally. 
Instructions to run the file are commented in the file. Requirements: node, notion-to-md node package (npm install), notion integration + api token.
